THE FIX EXPLAINED:
================================================================================

Problem: passlib 1.7.4 (from 2015) doesn't support bcrypt 5.0.0 (modern)
Solution: Upgraded to passlib 1.7.5 which supports modern bcrypt versions

Files Changed:
  • backend/requirements.txt: passlib[bcrypt]==1.7.4 → 1.7.5
  • backend/main.py: Added explicit bcrypt configuration

This is a CRITICAL fix needed for registration to work on Render.
