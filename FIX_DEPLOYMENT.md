# üîß FIX DEPLOYMENT ISSUE - ACTION PLAN

## Problem Identified

‚ùå **Render is running OLD code**
- Frontend showing old JS file (`main.53fe7175.js` instead of `main.2baa2815.js`)
- Backend showing `is_verified=0` (False) instead of `is_verified=1` (True)
- This means the deployed code doesn't have our fixes!

## Root Cause

Render cached/deployed an old version before our code changes. The latest commits haven't been deployed yet.

## Solution

### Step 1: Force Clear Database (if user already registered with old code)
On Render dashboard, you can manually clear the database:
```bash
# Option 1: Let Render auto-reset on redeploy
# Or Option 2: Manually delete database file (if you have shell access)
```

### Step 2: Manual Deploy (REQUIRED)
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select "crvkn-code-review-bot" service
3. Click **"Manual Deploy"** button (or go to Deployments ‚Üí Deploy latest commit)
4. Wait for deployment to complete
5. Check logs to verify deployment succeeded

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
1. Visit https://crvkn-code-review-bot.onrender.com
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Check Network tab - should see `main.2baa2815.js` (not `main.53fe7175.js`)
4. If still old JS, press Ctrl+Shift+Del to clear cache and refresh

### Step 4: Test Complete Flow
```
1. Register: New username/email/password
   Expected: "Registration successful" message
   Check DB: is_verified should be TRUE
   
2. Login: Same credentials
   Expected: Dashboard appears (NO OTP screen!)
   
3. Submit Code:
   Expected: Code review generated
   
4. Check History:
   Expected: Review visible in history
```

## Changes Made (Latest Commits)

**Commit f1879e06** - Force redeploy trigger
- Added version comment to main.py
- Included reset_database.py script
- Included trigger_redeploy.ps1 script

**Commit cfc81826** - Frontend rebuild
- Clean rebuilt frontend
- Removed OTP flow from components
- Updated production build

**Commits before that** - Backend fixes
- Registration: Auto-verify users (is_verified=True)
- Login: Remove verification check
- Database: Auto-create tables

## Expected Behavior After Redeployment

‚úÖ Register ‚Üí Auto-verified ‚Üí Can login immediately
‚úÖ Login ‚Üí No email/OTP check ‚Üí Instant access
‚úÖ Code Review ‚Üí Submit code ‚Üí Get review
‚úÖ History ‚Üí View all past reviews
‚úÖ Token ‚Üí 30-minute expiry, auto-renewed on login

## How to Know It's Fixed

**Frontend:**
- JS file should be `main.2baa2815.js` (not old version)
- No OTP screen after registration
- Redirect to login after registration

**Backend:**
- `is_verified` shows as True (1) in database
- Registration endpoint returns success message
- Login works without email verification

**Database:**
- Users table exists and auto-creates on startup
- New users have `is_verified=1` (True)
- Username uniqueness enforced

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing OTP screen after redeploy
**Fix:**
- Shift+Click refresh to hard reload
- Ctrl+Shift+Del to clear cache
- Try incognito mode
- Check Network tab to confirm new JS file

### Issue: "Username already registered" but user shouldn't exist
**Cause:** Old user data from before fixes
**Fix:** Use different username for testing
**Or:** Let me know if you want to clear database

### Issue: "Incorrect username or password" after redeployment
**Cause:** Database still has old users with old password hashing
**Fix:** Register a NEW test account
**Test credentials:** Use any new username/email not used before

### Issue: Login still shows OTP prompt
**Cause:** Frontend not updated
**Fix:** Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
Clear cache (Ctrl+Shift+Del)

## Commands to Run (If Needed)

### Local Reset (won't affect Render)
```bash
# Reset local database
python reset_database.py

# Rebuild frontend
cd frontend
npm run build
cd ..

# Verify
git status
```

### Force New Deploy
```bash
# Add timestamp trigger
git add backend/main.py
git commit -m "redeploy trigger"
git push origin odd2

# Then Manual Deploy on Render
```

## Checklist

- [x] Code committed to odd2 branch
- [x] Code pushed to GitHub
- [x] Frontend rebuilt
- [x] Deploy trigger added
- [ ] **MANUAL DEPLOY ON RENDER** (you must do this!)
- [ ] Verify new JS file loaded
- [ ] Test registration
- [ ] Test login
- [ ] Test code review
- [ ] Confirm `is_verified=1` in database

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **You MUST click "Manual Deploy" on Render**
- Automatic deploys only happen on new git push
- Manual Deploy forces immediate redeploy of latest code
- Takes 2-3 minutes to complete

üîê **Old User Data**
- If "rahul123" already registered with old code, use different username for testing
- Or clear database (let me know)

‚úÖ **After Redeploy**
- Test with NEW username (not used before)
- Should see auto-verification
- Should see instant dashboard access
