# Multiple File Upload Fix - Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **File Replacement Issue**
**Problem**: When uploading a second file, it was replacing the first file instead of adding to the selection.

**Solution**: Modified `handleFileUpload` function to:
- Check for duplicate files before adding
- Append new files to existing selection using `setSelectedFiles(prevFiles => [...prevFiles, ...fileObjs])`
- Update the code input to show all selected files

### 2. **Sequential Review Display**
**Problem**: Multiple file reviews were not clearly separated and displayed in order.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced the review processing to handle files sequentially with proper error handling
- Added file metadata (filename, fileIndex, totalFiles) to each review
- Implemented proper navigation between reviews using `currentReviewIndex`
- Added progress tracking and navigation UI

### 3. **UI Improvements**
**Additions**:
- **Navigation Controls**: Previous/Next buttons to move between file reviews
- **Progress Bar**: Visual indicator showing current review progress
- **File Counter**: Shows "Review X of Y" 
- **Clear All Button**: Allows users to remove all selected files at once
- **Individual File Remove**: Each file has its own remove button
- **Error Handling**: Failed file uploads show error messages instead of silently failing

### 4. **Backend Improvements**
**Changes**:
- Added optional `filename` parameter to `CodeInput` model
- Enhanced title generation to include filename when available
- Better error handling and logging for file processing

## Key Features Added:

1. **Multiple File Selection**: Users can select multiple files without replacement
2. **Sequential Processing**: Files are processed one by one in order
3. **Individual Reviews**: Each file gets its own separate review
4. **Navigation**: Easy navigation between multiple file reviews
5. **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicator for multiple file reviews
6. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for failed file processing
7. **File Management**: Easy removal of individual files or all files

## Testing Files Created:
- `test_file1.py` - Simple Python hello world function
- `test_file2.py` - Python calculator class
- `test_file3.js` - JavaScript array processing function

## How to Test:
1. Start the backend server: `cd backend && python main.py`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm start`
3. Navigate to the application
4. Upload the test files created above
5. Verify that:
   - All files are selected without replacement
   - Each file gets processed individually
   - Reviews are displayed one at a time with navigation
   - Progress is shown clearly
   - Files can be removed individually or all at once

## Expected Behavior:
- **File 1 Review** → **File 2 Review** → **File 3 Review** → **Thank You Page**
- Each review is complete and separate
- Navigation allows going back and forth between reviews
- Clear indication of which file is currently being reviewed
