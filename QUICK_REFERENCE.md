   ↓
[User] See full code review!
```

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR SUBMISSIONS
**Test**: Submit code → should see review

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (Broken)
- Register → Wait for OTP → Verify → Login
- Email blocking caused failures
- Users stuck at verification step
- Can't access code review features

### After (Fixed)
- Register → Auto-verified → Login immediately
- No email needed
- Users access code review instantly
- Full feature access for all users

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Email/OTP
- ❌ Intentionally disabled
- 📍 Reason: Render blocks outbound SMTP
- ✅ Alternative: Auto-verify users
- 🔄 Can restore: When email provider added

### Password Requirements
- ✓ Any length supported (72 byte limit per bcrypt)
- ✓ No special char requirements
- ✓ Hashing is one-way (cannot reverse)
- ✓ Same algo for register & login

### Token Expiry
- ⏱️ 30 minutes default
- 🔄 Auto-renewed on login
- ⚠️ After expiry: Must login again
- ✅ Users stay logged in while active

## 📞 If Something Goes Wrong

### Issue: "Incorrect username or password"
```
Cause:  User doesn't exist or wrong password
Fix:    - Try new test account
        - Check /admin/debug/users
        - Verify Render logs
```

### Issue: "Could not validate credentials"
```
Cause:  Token expired or invalid
Fix:    - Log out and back in
        - Clear browser cache
```

### Issue: Still see OTP screen
```
Cause:  Old frontend cached
Fix:    - Ctrl+Shift+Del (clear cache)
        - Ctrl+F5 (force refresh)
        - Try incognito mode
```

### Issue: Code review shows mock
```
Cause:  GOOGLE_API_KEY not set
Status: Expected - structure correct
Fix:    Add API key when ready
```
