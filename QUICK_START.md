    return eval(user_input)
```

3. **Review it** (will show standard review)

4. **Provide feedback**: "Focus more on security vulnerabilities"

5. **Submit new code**:
```python

## Verify It's Working

### Check Backend Logs

Look for these messages:
```
‚úÖ Found latest improvement suggestion for user 1: 'Focus more on security...'
üìù Incorporating user feedback into review prompt: 'Focus more on security...'
```

### Check Review Output

If feedback was "Focus on security", you'll see:
- üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced **SECURITY** section
- More detailed vulnerability analysis
- Security-focused recommendations
- Threat scenarios explained

---

## Common Feedback Examples

Try these suggestions:

### For Security Focus:
```
"Focus more on security vulnerabilities and potential exploits"
```

### For Performance:
```
"Emphasize performance optimization and efficiency"
```

### For Code Quality:
```
"Give detailed explanations and focus on code readability"
```

### For Best Practices:
```
"Check adherence to industry best practices and design patterns"
```

### Combined:

## What Happens to Old Feedback?

- ‚úÖ **Latest feedback is used** (most recent non-null)
- ‚úÖ Old feedback is kept in database but not used
- ‚úÖ Submit new feedback anytime to override

---

## Database Check (Optional)

Want to see stored feedback?

```sql
-- Connect to PostgreSQL
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d codereviewBot

-- View all feedback
SELECT id, improvement_suggestions, created_at 
FROM reviews 
WHERE improvement_suggestions IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Your latest feedback
SELECT improvement_suggestions 
FROM reviews 
WHERE user_id = 1 
AND improvement_suggestions IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```
